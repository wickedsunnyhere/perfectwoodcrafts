## Basic Hand Tools

### 1. Chisels
A set of basic chisels (1/4", 1/2", 3/4", and 1") is essential for:
- Cleaning up joints
- Carving details
- Making mortises
- General wood shaping

> **Pro Tip**: Always keep your chisels sharp. A dull chisel is not only ineffective but also dangerous.

### 2. Hand Planes
Start with:
- A block plane for end grain
- A No. 4 smoothing plane for surface preparation
- A No. 5 jack plane for flattening boards

### 3. Measuring and Marking Tools
- Quality combination square
- Marking knife
- Tape measure
- Marking gauge

### 1. Drill/Driver
A cordless drill/driver is perhaps the most versatile power tool you'll own. Look for:
- 18V or 20V battery system
- Multiple speed settings
- Brushless motor for longer life

### 2. Circular Saw
Before investing in a table saw, start with a quality circular saw:
- 15-amp motor
- Carbide-tipped blade
- Laser guide for accurate cuts

| Feature | Basic Model | Pro Model |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Power | 12A | 15A |
| Blade Size | 7-1/4" | 7-1/4" |
| Bevel Capacity | 45° | 56° |
| Laser Guide | No | Yes |
| Price Range | $50-100 | $100-200 |

### 3. Random Orbital Sander
Essential for surface preparation:
- 5" pad size
- Variable speed
- Dust collection capability

## Safety Equipment

Never compromise on safety. Essential safety gear includes:
- Safety glasses
- Hearing protection
- Dust mask or respirator
- Push sticks for power tools

## Conclusion

Remember, you don't need to buy everything at once. Start with the basics and add tools as your skills and projects demand. Focus on quality for tools you'll use frequently, and don't be afraid to buy entry-level versions of tools you'll use less often.

### Next Steps

1. Assess your immediate project needs
2. Set a realistic budget
3. Research specific tools within your budget
4. Consider buying used tools from reputable sources
5. Join a local woodworking group for advice and tool-sharing opportunities
